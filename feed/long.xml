      <title>Productively(?) Distracted</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-06-15-distracted/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/img/built/mZ_hdsFiYJ-2560.avif 2560w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/img/built/mZ_hdsFiYJ-2560.webp 2560w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://metagame.hk/img/built/mZ_hdsFiYJ-2560.png&quot; alt=&quot;I use Arch, btw&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that this whole &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/&quot;&gt;switching-to-Linux thing&lt;/a&gt; has been an elaborate distraction. Much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-01-09-default-apps-for-2025/&quot;&gt;switching to-do apps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2023-05-23-my-new-way-of-taking-book-notes/&quot;&gt;note-taking systems&lt;/a&gt; before it — it’s just something to take me away from the scary reality of doing &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; work. Like writing this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a perfect excuse, really. Setting up your &lt;em&gt;productivity&lt;/em&gt; system is &lt;em&gt;being productive&lt;/em&gt;, right? — it’s right there in the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you find yourself in a constant state of getting ready to &lt;em&gt;do the thing&lt;/em&gt;. And you never actually get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live. — Seneca, Letters from a Stoic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say it’s been entirely pointless. I’ve discovered a whole new (to me) paradigm of using a computer. I learned (okay, more like &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt;) a new operating system, terminal commands; I successfully installed Arch Linux, broke and fixed countless things, and I watched it all burn. I wrote scripts to pull weather and air quality index from publicly-available APIs and automatically put it into my daily note in Obsidian every morning. I scripted other small useful utilities: a service to optimize new images in Obsidian’s attachments folder, and one to sort files in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noodlesoft.com&quot;&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt;-like fashion. I found replacements for most of my daily-use software. I vibe-terminal-commanded myself into completely breaking my system and then set it up again. It was fun! And I learned a lot in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s part of the charm of Linux? There is no handholding. Instead, if you want to successfully install Steam and have it recognize all drivers (curse you, Nvidia!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Steam&quot;&gt;there’s a wiki page for that&lt;/a&gt;. Setting up your system means a lot Reddit browsing, googling, and AI-prompting to troubleshoot random stuff. It’s a lot of time spent trying to find a single post on some obscure forum where someone had a similar problem like you and managed to come up with a workaround. Jumping through hoops like that earns you nerd cred, but it costs a lot of time and frustration. (But once you figure it out, it’s so satisfying!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I want to &lt;em&gt;do the thing&lt;/em&gt; instead of tinkering with the operating system, I’m back on the Mac (or iPad). It’s bland, sanitized, safe, and unfun — and not amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/os/macos/&quot;&gt;new shiny&lt;/a&gt; will change that —  but it gets out of the way and is not distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;new shiny&lt;/em&gt;, the WWDC announcements were kind of &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;. The new design invokes no feelings whatsoever. But I am looking forward to seeing the updates to iPadOS in action. Did they finally figure out the tablet multi-tasking? (I’ve been fooled so many times, though!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway… If I were switching from Windows, I would have definitely stayed with Linux. Easy choice. It’s just so much better. No bloat, no upsells, it looks nicer, it’s more efficient, it does not spy on you, and it’s farther from US big tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mac is… complicated. It does have upsells baked into the system, it is US big tech, it is trying too hard to pose as safe — but I have an efficient workflow here, it looks &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s more elegant than Windows. Plus, the whole Apple ecosystem gives it an undeniable advantage, no matter how many open source app replacements I can find on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… enough messing with .conf files. Time to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Here&#39;s What Helped Me Build This Blog With 11ty/Eleventy and GitHub Pages</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-20-personal-website-on-11ty-github-pages/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am finally happy with my website set-up. It’s not much — just some HTML, CSS, and a few templates — but it’s mine, I can configure it however I want, and I own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a journey, not gonna lie. Not everything worked out of the box, not for a website like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are some things that official 11ty documentation doesn’t tell you. Let me save you the frustration and AI tokens. In this post I will go through the roadblocks I encountered — and how I&#39;ve cleared them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with how I wanted to design Metagame. The choices here strongly influenced the solutions I used — and problems I faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stephango.com/file-over-app&quot;&gt;File over app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This website is just a bunch of files in folders. There is no platform, no store-bought template with inscrutable code, no Squarespace-like WYSIWYG. There is no lock-in. I’m not totally independent (I still need to host this page somewhere), but it&#39;s as close as I could reasonably get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast &amp;amp; lightweight&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s all static HTML, which should make it load quickly. There is no CMS and no database on someone’s platform that I need to query every time I want to navigate to a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/&quot;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. My content and my updates — they all start on my website and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; get syndicated elsewhere. For me, Metagame is the center of my online presence. Everything I post starts here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple code&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#39;m neither a programmer nor an app developer. I can work with basic code but don&#39;t talk to me about complex frameworks. Also, I don&#39;t mind vibe coding — as long as it returns something I can remotely understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy is not an afterthought&lt;/strong&gt;. You won’t see Google Analytics here. In the future, I may consider something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://plausible.io/for-bloggers-creators&quot;&gt;Plausible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to develop the website locally and offline&lt;/strong&gt;. This is what primarily led me to 11ty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to &lt;strong&gt;escape US big tech&lt;/strong&gt;, but unfortunately both VS Code and GitHub are owned by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a super-important disclaimer: even though I&#39;ve developed a few websites before, I still consider myself a total beginner in this. I have not been keeping up with the current trends in web design, like at all. So please treat this as a record of a beginner stumbling his way through to solutions that are likely obvious (and/or even suboptimal) to veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if your a beginner like myself, there&#39;s a good chance you will find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problems and solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Permalink prefix for relative links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the source code of my blog posts, all links are relative. Instead of pointing directly to a full URL (for example: &lt;code&gt;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/&lt;/code&gt;), they link to a relative path (like so: &lt;code&gt;/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This causes some issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I build locally, all is fine. But the second I deploy to GitHub Pages, stuff breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured it was this: before custom domain, the page is hosted at the following address: &lt;code&gt;https://my_account_name.github.io/metagame/&lt;/code&gt;
But the relative link &lt;code&gt;/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/&lt;/code&gt; tries to resolve to &lt;code&gt;https://my_account_name.github.io/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/&lt;/code&gt; and not the correct one &lt;code&gt;https://my_account_name.github.io/metagame/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, here is a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; solution for this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#deploy-to-a-subdirectory-with-a-path-prefix&quot;&gt;--pathprefix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/#mini-tutorials&quot;&gt;This is how you&#39;re supposed to use it&lt;/a&gt; when building on GitHub Pages. But for some reason it did not work for me. In the build, all links had multiple &lt;code&gt;/metagame/metagame/metagame/…&lt;/code&gt; folders inside them. For some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after some googling, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/discussions/2516#discussioncomment-11999750&quot;&gt;this script for relative links&lt;/a&gt;. It worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up custom domain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage my domain DNS record on Cloudflare. When setting up the integration between GitHub Pages and Cloudflare, I wish two things were more obvious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That you have to add and verify your domain first in your general account setting (and not the repository settings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site&quot;&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is helpful, I just wish someone showed me a screenshot of what a correct configuration looks like. So here it is:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/img/built/HiDAfADRSY-1420.avif 1420w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/img/built/HiDAfADRSY-1420.webp 1420w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://metagame.hk/img/built/HiDAfADRSY-1420.png&quot; alt=&quot;DNS set up in Cloudflare&quot; width=&quot;1420&quot; height=&quot;302&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Missing GitHub Pages Deploy Keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/#mini-tutorials&quot;&gt;mini-tutorial in 11ty docs&lt;/a&gt; had one crucial piece missing — it doesn&#39;t tell you that you need to generate GitHub security keys and where to put them. This gave me a lot of trouble as I did not know what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lea-tortay.com/articles/github-pages-eleventy/&quot;&gt;this guide from Lėa Tortay&lt;/a&gt; did mention keys and got me started. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eleventy-image causing super-long build times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do images right this time. Serve optimized versions, save bandwidth, make the website faster. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/&quot;&gt;eleventy-image&lt;/a&gt; plugin. It would automatically optimize images while building the website. Just what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one hiccup, though. It was processing every image from scratch on every GitHub Pages build. That led to 5+ minute deploy times every time, even for such a small site like mine. Unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what no-one told me: you have to point the eleventy-image output directory to .cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;imageOptions.outputDir = &amp;quot;.cache/@11ty/img/&amp;quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course! That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Redirects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new blog has a different folder structure than what I had on Ghost (here posts are stored in ,&lt;code&gt;/posts/&lt;/code&gt;  folder; in Ghost they were all in the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; folder) — meaning permalinks to my blog posts would  — an inbound links would break. Fortunately, a redirect template can take care of that. Leave no broken link behind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the same problem, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://brianm.me/posts/eleventy-redirect-from/&quot;&gt;follow these instructions&lt;/a&gt; and you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, as far as I can remember, these were the biggest head-scratchers for me. Hope this saves you some time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other helpful resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below have been hugely helpful in learning how all of this works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/&quot;&gt;Official Get Started Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4&quot;&gt;6 Minutes to Build a Blog from Scratch with Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW&quot;&gt;Eleventy Crash Course by Jaydan Urwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lmnt.me/blog/how-to-make-a-damn-website.html&quot;&gt;How to Make a Damn Website&lt;/a&gt; was a good refresher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rknight.me/&quot;&gt;Robb Knight’s blog&lt;/a&gt; was an inspiration for using 11ty and many blogging principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/copilot&quot;&gt;GitHub AI Copilot in VS Code&lt;/a&gt; deserves a shout-out too. Things like the default two-column view on the front page or dark mode in style.css were all vibe-coded with a few prompts. As much of an AI skeptic that I am, I have to admint that this is a great use-case for AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>A different relationship with tech</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My attitude towards &lt;em&gt;tech&lt;/em&gt; has changed considerably in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer am I optimistic about where things are going. No longer am I excited about the new technology advancements. Because what are they, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We made a slightly better phone this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-04-03-a-lot-less-excited-about-nintendo-switch-2/&quot;&gt;slightly bigger and slightly more performant Switch&lt;/a&gt; than the last one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, the latest and greatest is not much greater than last year’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2024-09-13-iphone-13-pro-exit-interview/&quot;&gt;ready to replace my iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year that I wrote it an eulogy — yet, ultimately I kept it for another year. 16 Pro was incredibly disappointing and I passed. A camera button and some half-baked “AI” features? Come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m even thinking of skipping the 17s this year too. Just going to keep the 13 Pro until Apple finally releases a foldable. Hopefully next year! Now that would be something interesting — first time in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a larger phenomenon than just a new iPhone being uninspiring. Tech just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-TANCVoHlc&quot;&gt;isn’t fun anymore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ctM2TIXDFQs?si=lQd1XUx8ud5tHuvI&quot;&gt;Being online is tiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enshittification and monetization are sucking all the joy out of everything. Websites, services, apps, platforms, games — getting worse every year while becoming more expensive at the same time. Finding new ways to squeeze out revenue instead of finding new ways of making a better product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how long can this go on? There must be a limit where a product just becomes completely unusable under the weight of all that bullshit. At some point we won’t have any more money to spend on subscriptions, loot boxes, battle passes, micro-transactions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be a point where things finally break. When &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; break and don’t accept this nonsense anymore. Am I there already? Maybe that’s why I’m so surprisingly open to &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/&quot;&gt;the idea of trying out Linux&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This Is the Year of Linux on Desktop</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a restless mind. I constantly look for ways to tinker with stuff. And once something works, I can&#39;t just leave it be and enjoy it. I have to move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-03-31-is-apple-even-good-at-software/&quot;&gt;Last month&lt;/a&gt; it was (re-)introducing pen and paper to my note-taking system. Before that, it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2024-12-15-things-look-like-a-creative-goty/&quot;&gt;back-and-forth between Reminders and Things&lt;/a&gt; for my to-do system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine how dangerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/pVI_smLgTY0?si=BmXPv3MjrxTFV14Z&amp;amp;ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;What’s stopping me right now is&lt;/s&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;Framework Laptops&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;s&gt;not shipping to Hong Kong…&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually installed Ubuntu on my gaming laptop today, alongside existing Windows 11 installation. Just to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t get far. I&#39;ll probably encounter some insurmountable barrier and give up. I will inevitably bump into some jankiness, critical apps with outdated design (looking at you, Libre Office), or things simply not working (as I write this I struggle to make my external monitor to work!) I just hope that some big disappointment happens before I manage to spend any extra money to plug Linux into my workflow. Because I would have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart my 1Password subscription for a cross-platform password manager (currently with Apple Passwords)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move my email from iCloud back to Fastmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable Obsidian sync, since my notes would no longer sync over iCloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a new to-do app (Tick Tick looks like a decent candidate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably subscribe to Spotify instead of Apple Music (or give YouTube Music another try?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming I stick with YouTube for #5, which at the moment doesn&#39;t cost me anything beyond what I&#39;m already paying, items 1-4 still add up to USD 215 per year. That is not insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s the cost of time required for setting everything up (though, let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s the fun part) and moving my to-do&#39;s to some new app (switching mission-critical apps, assuming you even find a suitable replacement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ljpuk.net/2025/05/04/tasks-out-of-sight-dont-get-done/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;can be a headache&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there&#39;s the sunk/opportunity cost in under-using (or not using at all) the devices I already own, primarily my iPad Pro and Mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I think about that last one – it raises the biggest question of all. Linux would primarily replace MacOS for me. But then, Mac is the only platform Apple has not fully locked down yet. So why even try to escape it now? With Mac, I don&#39;t have the same frustrations Windows users have. There is less incentive to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can do is to lay the groundwork for eventually leaving Apple&#39;s lock-in. A decision I&#39;m inching closer and closer to every time Apple does something greedy, malicious, or when it ingratiates itself with Trump. Which is very often these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely wanted to be excited about &lt;strong&gt;Switch 2&lt;/strong&gt; (it was my most anticipated hardware announcement this year!), yet – if I&#39;m being honest with myself – it just looks like a bad buy for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve barely touched my Switch OLED since I bought it. (A painful realization!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;The Duskbloods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; console-exclusive, that initially looked like it would scratch my &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne 2&lt;/em&gt; itch – turns out it&#39;s a PvPvE game! No, thanks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t have any strong feelings or nostalgia for &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong, Mario Kart,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Kirby&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything else, including &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight: Silksong&lt;/em&gt;, will be available on PC, it will look A LOT better there, and I already have Steam Deck OLED to play those games on the go (and with OLED!)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt; with its art style in particular – I expect it to look much better on OLED compared to LCD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than that, the third party games looked really poor. I know Switch isn&#39;t about high-end specs and cutting-edge graphics, but that&#39;s really not an excuse for releasing a game that looks like &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Legends Z-A&lt;/em&gt; in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices, both hardware and games, are high enough to give me pause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of prices, the fact they’re charging for their equivalent of &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Aperture Desk Job&lt;/em&gt; is such an own goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected something that would bring me back to the Switch — but last night&#39;s Nintendo Direct wasn&#39;t it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, whatever excitement I had about it initially is now fading. Maybe I was just hyped for an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of a shiny new thing. Once I set emotions aside, Switch 2 doesn&#39;t look like a device for me.&lt;/p&gt;
