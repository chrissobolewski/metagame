            <h1>Google Zero, Small Web 1.0</h1>
            <time>05 August 2025</time>
            <p>It’s 2025. Internet is being flooded with AI slop and misinformation. Google doesn’t drive traffic anymore, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/">it keeps it for itself</a> instead — with AI summaries and top results reserved exclusively for ads. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/27/musk-x-throttle-links-threads-bluesky/">Social media throttle links</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a great environment to build a new website in. Building an audience is harder than ever. But maybe, <em>just maybe</em> we can use this to our advantage.</p>
<p>There is value in independence from platforms and big tech. In maintaining a simple website that’s just files and folders — and not a database, scripts, and dynamic content. There is value in providing <em>a personal perspective on a personal website</em> to a small group of readers. Not everything has to scale, not everything has to pursue infinite growth, not everything has to be ruthlessly monetized.</p>
<p>Maybe returning to the Web 1.0 formula — a collection of websites connected through hyperlinks instead of social graphs and algorithms — is the way to go for small creators like myself.</p>
<p>I enjoy linking out to other bloggers and pointing my readers to things that I <em>found elsewhere</em> and <em>found interesting</em>. <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/links-make-the-web-great/">Links are great</a>! It’s so much better to send you into a rabbit-hole with a context-relevant link rather than stuffing this website with AI slop and SEO-optimized word salads. That’s where <em>small web</em> really shines. You can enjoy the process of discovery, feel a sense of wonder, and get lost in the web — it’s fun!</p>
<p>METAGAME is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience">Google Zero</a> blog. I receive pretty much zero traffic from search engines (apart from a handful of people encountering <a href="https://metagame.hk/posts/2024-09-29-leica-d-lux-8-as-a-travel-camera/">my Leica D-Lux 8 post</a> that way) and social media. My dream/goal/hope is that other websites and blogs that I value would eventually link to something interesting they found <em>here</em>. That's how I want to build my audience.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cutting our ability to reach more people sucks. But this might be a blessining in disguise. By denying us traffic, Google has set us free. We can write for humans again and care not for the SEO crawlers (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695501/cloudflare-block-ai-crawlers-default">block AI bots</a>). Words once again flow from interest, values, and personality — not from a SEO manual.</p>
<p>So go ahead, <a href="https://metagame.hk/blogroll/">explore my blogroll</a>. On top of that, here are two more blogs I’ve discovered just this past week. Diving into their archives now:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bjhess.com">Barry Hess</a></li>
<li><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com">Manuel “Manu” Moreale</a></li>
</ul>
