            <h1>One Last Pizza Toast</h1>
            <time>01 November 2022</time>

<em>Day 13: Kyoto, Hong Kong, 13,297 steps, 10.9 kilometers</em></p>
<p><em>Programming note: In my <a href="../2022-10-31-the-uji-excursion/"><em>last entry</em></a> I had anticipated that this one is going to be shorter. Instead, it’s regular-length, but late. I hope that’s okay?</em></p>
<p>I search Google Maps for 喫茶店 one last time. Doing that around 7:30 am with “open now” filter applied should get me the result I want (I’ve noticed coffee chains and third-wave coffee shops here usually don’t open until 9-11-ish am).</p>
<p>And there it is! Coffee Amazon, about a 20-minute walk from the hotel. And it has pizza toast on the menu. Jackpot!</p>
<p>I walk through the drizzle, covering my camera from the rain with my jacket (give me better weather sealing, Leica!) — I take it out only to take pictures of people carrying transparent umbrellas. I want to catch that signature (cliche?) Japan picture. I mostly fail — my rangefinder focusing skills are still no match for moving subjects (partly because lack of skill, partly because I stubbornly insist to shoot at wide apertures). I settle for static objects instead.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="../../img/built/hYNQ0vSCU9-2000.avif 2000w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="../../img/built/hYNQ0vSCU9-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../img/built/hYNQ0vSCU9-2000.jpeg" alt="Rainy Kyoto" width="2000" height="1500"></picture></p>
<h3>Running on fumes</h3>
<p>While walking to Coffee Amazon I realize I’ve passed the 250-kilometer mark on my way. Well, less <em>realize</em> — more like I'm counting down the meters. 250 clicks — no small feat.</p>
<p>And I can tell. The <em>body</em> is exhausted, but <em>I</em> feel good! <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/149/?ref=metagame.hk">“Few things feel better than the body [many] days into a good long walk.”</a></p>
<p>It’s weird, though. The legs are tired, but they want to keep moving.</p>
<hr>
<p>I arrive, get my usual <em>morning set,</em> and chat a bit with the lady running the establishment.</p>
<p>It’s been two weeks. And this is my last <em>kissaten</em>, last pizza toast in Japan. I linger more than usual, just to cherish that moment.</p>
<p>When I eventually leave, the lady bids me farewell saying “Be careful in Hong Kong.” Feels sad.</p>

<hr>
<p>Lunch makes me walk even more. I want to end my stay in Kyoto on a high note. Like, with a meal that leaves a lasting impression (of a good kind). Omakase sushi is my choice.</p>
<p>At the first restaurant I visit, they say they’re not open for lunch today and they will only be serving dinner. (Google Maps and their website say they’re open for lunch. Whatever.)</p>
<p>The second restaurant says they only accept guests with reservations. Heck, was I aiming too high? — should I settle for a more down-to-earth meal? Why is this so hard?</p>
<p>The rain is getting worse. Giving it one last try.</p>
<p>Third restaurant. Sushiiwa. I’m greeted with a question “Reservation?”. “No.” I say resigned — but they don’t send me away right away. “Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>“You’re lucky. Please sit at the counter.”</p>
<p>Reader, what happened next was my best restaurant experience in Kyoto.</p>
<hr>
<p>Toshiya-san introduces himself as the chef and owner. He speaks perfect English. He notices my camera and recommends I visit the Leica Store in Gion — apparently, apart from the cameras, they have a great photo exhibition there. (Too bad I won’t have time for that today.)</p>
<p>The man exudes warmth. He’s so welcoming and <em>very</em> chatty. Over the next hour, he stops at my seat multiple times — not just to serve the food, but to continue our conversation.</p>
<p>We talk about his business. Third generation running it. Started by his father 65 years ago just a few blocks from where we are now. Today, Toshiya-san owns it, and his daughter is working there as well.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="../../img/built/0PtLmTAj-F-2000.avif 2000w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="../../img/built/0PtLmTAj-F-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../img/built/0PtLmTAj-F-2000.jpeg" alt="The Ohnishi family running Sushiiwa" width="2000" height="1500"></picture></p>
<p>The last three years have been tough. Business went down 70% — Japan was closed to tourists. He said the restaurant was only able to survive because he owns the building. Whole family lives upstairs. Had he had to pay rent to a landlord, he would’ve gone bust for sure. Many other restaurants in the area have.</p>
<p>But October 11th, 2022 was like flipping a switch. Everything is suddenly back in full force. Floodgates are open, tourists are pouring in. He’s fully booked on most days (he reiterates how lucky I am to be able to get a walk-in seat today). It’s bit of a shock for him and the staff to have to adjust to being this busy again.</p>
<p>Food comes at a steady pace. A few appetizers, fantastic sashimi!, soup, and eight pieces of sushi served one by one. He brings my attention to the soy sauce. “This is Kyoto-style soy sauce, different from Tokyo-style” — he says — “Less salty, milder, and sweeter.” I learned something new today.</p>
<p>Smile’s not leaving my face throughout the entire meal. So happy I found this place! Being turned out by the first two restaurants today was no bad luck at all. On the contrary! It allowed me to discover this establishment.</p>
<p>Thoroughly enjoyed the food, the welcoming atmosphere, and the chat. <a href="http://www.sushiiwa.jp/en/?ref=metagame.hk">Sushiiwa</a> — I highly recommend it! Please check it out if you’re ever in the Kyoto Station area. (You might need to make a reservation!)</p>
<p>Speaking of Kyoto Station — that’s where I go next.</p>
<h3>Tadaima!</h3>
<p>From here, it’s all just the way home. I board the Hello Kitty-themed train to the airport. I get on a KIX-HKG flight. Gets uncomfortably bumpy in the last hour — we’re flying through a typhoon that’s over Hong Kong right now.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="../../img/built/hyytVEn_yr-2000.avif 2000w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="../../img/built/hyytVEn_yr-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../img/built/hyytVEn_yr-2000.jpeg" alt="Hello Kitty train" width="2000" height="1500"></picture></p>
<p>Inbound passenger processing at Hong Kong International Airport is surprisingly smooth — it took about 40 minutes from disembarking the plane to getting on AirPort Express. So much better than 4+ hours I had to endure on my way back from Poland last year (not to mention the lack of hotel quarantine this time around).</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="../../img/built/z8hjpcgvur-2000.avif 2000w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="../../img/built/z8hjpcgvur-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../img/built/z8hjpcgvur-2000.jpeg" alt="Welcome home" width="2000" height="1500"></picture></p>
<p>One more taxi ride.</p>
<p>And then it’s 9:50 pm HKT on a Tuesday. I’m back home.</p>
<p><em>Another programming note: There will be one more entry in this series. After I get some rest?</em></p>
