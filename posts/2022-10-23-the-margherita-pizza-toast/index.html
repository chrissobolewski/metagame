            <h1>The Margherita Pizza Toast</h1>
            <time>23 October 2022</time>
            <p><em>Day 4: Matsumoto, 26,740 steps, 21.2 kilometers</em></p>
<p>Reader, I have found it. The fabled pizza toast. A basic one — just bread with tomato sauce and some cheese on top — but I will take it. I can appreciate simplicity.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="../../img/built/vIBkipuz-m-1536.avif 1536w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="../../img/built/vIBkipuz-m-1536.webp 1536w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../img/built/vIBkipuz-m-1536.jpeg" alt="Azeimichi" width="1536" height="2048"></picture></p>
<p>Found this kissa — Azemichi — at a street corner just a couple blocks away from my hotel. By the time I got there, the place was full. Mostly regulars, I think? The owners — a cute elderly couple — were tearing coupons off the coffee tickets on the wall for the majority of orders.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to walk a lot today. But somehow 20 kilometers happened anyway. There must be something in the Matsumoto water, I’m sure of it. Every time I come back from a long hike — sore all over — and soak in the hot spring, it’s like my legs are saying “hey, we’re good as new, let’s go for a walk again”. So we go.</p>

<p>I’m starting to realize that kissatens are not about coffee at all. It’s the atmosphere. The community — small town, people know each other, shop owners chat with the chat before taking the order and of course the regulars use the coffee tickets.</p>
<p>Coffee tickets are like shop loyalty cards, but better. Because you don’t have to carry it with you — it’s stored under your name in the shop itself.</p>
<p>Ingenious!</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>Sometimes, <em>sometimes</em> kissas are about the food. And, gosh, I think I’ve just had the best cheesecake in my life this afternoon?</p>
<p>Moist but fluffy at the same time. Just the right amount of sweetness. And a tiny hint of rum — just enough so you know it’s there, but by no means overpowering the classic cheesecake flavor. Heavenly!</p>

<p>I’ve been obsessed by this yakitori restaurant from the start. Every time I passed by, I stopped. To look around, to take a picture. Mesmerized by the colors, by the smoke that comes out from the exhaust, and by the smells carried by that smoke.</p>
<p>I had to try it. And it did not disappoint. I keep ordering more and more skewers. My heart and stomach are content.</p>

<p>That concludes my last full day in Matsumoto. Tomorrow — Karuizawa and maybe, <em>maybe</em> and hour or two in Nagano. I’m excited!</p>
<p>— Chris</p>
