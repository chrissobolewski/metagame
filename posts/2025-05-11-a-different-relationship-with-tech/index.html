            <h1>A different relationship with tech</h1>
            <time>11 May 2025</time>
            <p>My attitude towards <em>tech</em> has changed considerably in the last five years.</p>
<p>No longer am I optimistic about where things are going. No longer am I excited about the new technology advancements. Because what are they, really?</p>
<p><em>We made a slightly better phone this year.</em></p>
<p><em>We made a <a href="../2025-04-03-a-lot-less-excited-about-nintendo-switch-2/">slightly bigger and slightly more performant Switch</a> than the last one.</em></p>
<p>Great, thank you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thing is, the latest and greatest is not much greater than last year’s.</p>
<p>I was so <a href="../2024-09-13-iphone-13-pro-exit-interview/">ready to replace my iPhone 13 Pro</a> last year that I wrote it an eulogy — yet, ultimately I kept it for another year. 16 Pro was incredibly disappointing and I passed. A camera button and some half-baked “AI” features? Come on.</p>
<p>I’m even thinking of skipping the 17s this year too. Just going to keep the 13 Pro until Apple finally releases a foldable. Hopefully next year! Now that would be something interesting — first time in a while.</p>
<p>But it’s a larger phenomenon than just a new iPhone being uninspiring. Tech just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-TANCVoHlc">isn’t fun anymore</a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/ctM2TIXDFQs?si=lQd1XUx8ud5tHuvI">Being online is tiring</a>.</p>
<p>Enshittification and monetization are sucking all the joy out of everything. Websites, services, apps, platforms, games — getting worse every year while becoming more expensive at the same time. Finding new ways to squeeze out revenue instead of finding new ways of making a better product.</p>
<p>Just how long can this go on? There must be a limit where a product just becomes completely unusable under the weight of all that bullshit. At some point we won’t have any more money to spend on subscriptions, loot boxes, battle passes, micro-transactions, etc.</p>
<p>There must be a point where things finally break. When <em>people</em> break and don’t accept this nonsense anymore. Am I there already? Maybe that’s why I’m so surprisingly open to <a href="../2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/">the idea of trying out Linux</a>?</p>
