<em>Nintendo Switch 2 / Image: Nintendo</em></p>
<p>I genuinely wanted to be excited about <strong>Switch 2</strong> (it was my most anticipated hardware announcement this year!), yet – if I'm being honest with myself – it just looks like a bad buy for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've barely touched my Switch OLED since I bought it. (A painful realization!)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/?ref=metagame.hk">The Duskbloods</a>, <em>the</em> console-exclusive, that initially looked like it would scratch my <em>Bloodborne 2</em> itch – turns out it's a PvPvE game! No, thanks.</li>
<li>Don't have any strong feelings or nostalgia for <em>Donkey Kong, Mario Kart,</em> or <em>Kirby</em>.</li>
<li>Everything else, including <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, will be available on PC, it will look A LOT better there, and I already have Steam Deck OLED to play those games on the go (and with OLED!)
<ul>
<li><em>Hollow Knight</em> with its art style in particular – I expect it to look much better on OLED compared to LCD.</li>
<li>Other than that, the third party games looked really poor. I know Switch isn't about high-end specs and cutting-edge graphics, but that's really not an excuse for releasing a game that looks like <em>Pokemon Legends Z-A</em> in 2025.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prices, both hardware and games, are high enough to give me pause.</li>
<li>Speaking of prices, the fact they’re charging for their equivalent of <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> and <em>Aperture Desk Job</em> is such an own goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expected something that would bring me back to the Switch — but last night's Nintendo Direct wasn't it.</p>
<p>All in all, whatever excitement I had about it initially is now fading. Maybe I was just hyped for an <em>idea</em> of a shiny new thing. Once I set emotions aside, Switch 2 doesn't look like a device for me.</p>
