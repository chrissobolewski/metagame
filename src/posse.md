You clicked a link on social media, probably expected it to lead you to a lengthier post over here, but instead you got the exact same text you just saw. What happened?

This is working exactly as intended. All my [short updates](https://metagame.hk/updatefeed/) are posted to METAGAME first and then automatically shared (or "syndicated") to various social media sites (with a link back to the blog). This is [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). This is how we reclaim the web for small creators and away from big tech platforms. 

If you're looking for longer blog articles, [you can find my blog post archive here](https://metagame.hk/archive/).
