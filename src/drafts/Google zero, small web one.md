# Google 0, Small Web 1.0
Grifters are flooding the internet with AI slop and misinformation. Google doesn’t drive traffic anymore, it keeps it for itself instead — with AI summaries and top results reserved exclusively for ads. Social media throttle links.

This is not a great environment to build a new website in. Building an audience is harder than ever. But maybe, just maybe we can use this to our advantage.

There is value in independence from platforms and big tech. In maintaining a simple website that’s just files and folders — and not a database, scripts, and dynamic content. There is value in providing a personal perspective on a personal website to a small but engaged group of readers. Not everything has to scale, not everything has to pursue indefinite growth.

Maybe returning to the Web 1.0 formula — a collection of websites connected through hyperlinks instead of social graphs and algorithms — is the way to go for small creators like myself.

I enjoy linking out to other bloggers and pointing my readers to things that I found elsewhere and found interesting. It’s discovery, it’s sense of wonder, it’s getting lost *in the web* — it’s fun! It’s so much better to send you into a rabbit-hole with a context-relevant link and none of the AI slop and SEO-optimized word salads.

METAGAME is a [google-zero](https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience) blog. I receive pretty much zero traffic from Google (apart from a handful of people encountering my Leica D-Lux 8 post that way) and social media. I’d trade going viral for recognition on blogs I read and like any day.

By denying us traffic Google has set us free. We can write for humans again and care not for the SEO crawler bots. Words that flow from interest, values, and personality — not from a SEO manual.
