Here is a list of things you will not find on METAGAME:
- Cookies
- JavaScript (except for Umami)
- Tracking pixels and such
- Pop-ups and other nagging stuff
- Ads
- Social sharing buttons

Meanwhile, METAGAME uses:
- 11ty framework to generate static HTML pages
- 11ty plugins (RSS, image)
- Web fonts
- Occasionally, embeds of other media (social media, YouTube videos, etc.) 
- Cloudflare
- Privacy-focused Analytics (Umami): no Cookies, no spying, not collecting personal data, traffic data not hosted in the US

No spying, no tracking â€” just text on a webpage. As it should be.
