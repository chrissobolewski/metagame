Here is a list of things you will not find on METAGAME:
- Cookies
- JavaScript
- Tracking pixels and such
- Pop-ups and other nagging stuff
- Ads

- Analytics (except traffic monitored through Cloudflare)

Meanwhile, METAGAME uses:

No spying, no tracking â€” just text on a webpage. As it should be.
