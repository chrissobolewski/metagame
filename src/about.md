# Hi, I'm Chris!

At my day job I am a market researcher/consultant/manager. After work, I try to tend to my hobbies — and that last part is what I typically write about on Metagame.

My hobbies and interests change from time to time, but as of 2025 they include:
- Running
- Video games
- [Exploring Linux](https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/)
- [Building this blog](https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-20-personal-website-on-11ty-github-pages/)
- Photography (these days, mostly travel and less streetphoto)

I used to be a fan of tech and excited about trying out new devices. [But no more](https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/). Tech isn't fun to me anymore. That said, I still like tinkering with stuff.

Before Metagame, I was a community manager for a fintech startup and I ran a fairly-successful blog on personal finance called Metafinanse. It was in Polish and it’s now defunct after I moved to Hong Kong.

Hong Kong has been my home for 8 years now. We have been through some stuff…
