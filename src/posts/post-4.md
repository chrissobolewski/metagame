I’m amazed by how friendly the people here are. I mean — you just walk around, point your camera and random stuff, and a lady at a shop across the street just starts posing for you. 

I wasn’t sure how Craig Mod does it, but I start to get it now. People are nice here and approaching them feels less scary — even for an introvert.
