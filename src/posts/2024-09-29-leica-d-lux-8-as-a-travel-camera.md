*I sold my Ricoh GR IIIx for thisâ€¦*

Iâ€™ve just edited and printed the photos from my ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Hokkaido trip. Happy to report that **Leica D-Lux 8** was competent as a travel camera.

I was surprised how I used pretty much the entire zoom range. Got a bunch of wide-angle photos (24-28 mm equivalent), some in the mid-range (35-50 mm equiv.), and a number of shots on the telephoto end (75 mm equiv.). That versatility was very welcome during the trip.

The size and portability were also a god-send during travel. D-Lux 8 is fast and convenient. And incredibly light. When doing 20k-ish steps a day, every gram you carry in your bag counts. And thatâ€™s the primary reason I usually left my M11 behind. I packed both for the trip but in comparison M11 was just too heavy, too slow, and too cumbersome. The only occasion I took it out was at Slow Boat in Sapporo.

The downside, of course, is image quality. Comparing the M11 and D-Lux 8 side by side shows the difference clearly. Plus, the smaller sensor renders less bokeh. Itâ€™s still a good few levels above my ðŸ“± [iPhone 13 Pro](/posts/2024-09-13-iphone-13-pro-exit-interview/) and infinitely less annoying (hate, hate, hate what Apple does to image processing these days; going [Process Zero](https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/?ref=metagame.hk) all the way).

All in all, I am willing to compromise on image quality for the sake of convenience and speed.

But thenâ€¦ I wonder if Iâ€™m just getting lazy? Preferring a smaller camera with autofocus(!), zoom(!!), and sometimes even in program mode(!!!) â€” instead of using a rangefinder and a more manual approach. Sacrilege! Why would one do it?

Is it old age â€” and less tolerance for fuss that comes with it? Or was it the fast-paced, packed itinerary of travel that made me opt for more ease-of-use and speed?

It makes me think about my photography journey. It started with an analog camera and developing black-and-white films in my bathroom. Then came digital â€” and I still was all about image quality, using primes, going full-frame. And now, often Iâ€™m happy with just my small, capable, zoom point-and-shoot. Sometimes, a 60 MP, full-frame sensor and a Leica prime is an overkill. D-Lux is my *everyday* camera. M11 â€” I find I need to be in a specific mood for it.

Nothing wrong with that.

The last major thing Iâ€™m missing with the D-Lux 8 is Leica Looks. Give me that and I can even skip â€” or greatly minimize â€” the editing process. Hope itâ€™s coming in a firmware update sometime soon. That way I can be even lazierâ€¦
