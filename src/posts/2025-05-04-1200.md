**Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is a Masterpiece.**

It’s been a while since a piece of art enamored me so completely.

I’m in love with this game. World, characters, story, visuals, gameplay, soundtrack — enchanting, captivating, unique.

The hype is real. Believe the [high metacritic scores](https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/?ref=metagame.hk), trust all the positive reviews. This game is special. It deserves the reverence it’s been met with so far.

I can sing its praises for many more paragraphs, but let me stop here. [Just go and play it](https://www.expedition33.com/?ref=metagame.hk). The less say about it the better — it’s best to go in blind.
