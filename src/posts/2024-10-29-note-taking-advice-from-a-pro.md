The thing about note-taking, or any other *productivity* advice, is that it often comes from self-proclaimed “productivity experts”. People who rarely know any other work than writing or making YouTube videos about productivity.

Andy Matuschak [puts it well](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z51q8prEJzs5Jqa5WPThYoV?ref=metagame.hk):

> Most people who write about note-taking don’t seem particularly accomplished in their own fields, whatever those may be. In fact, most such writers aren’t applying their notes to some exogenous creative problem: their primary creative work is writing about productivity. These writers offer advice on note-taking to help scientists and executives with the challenges of their work, but the advice was developed in a context disconnected from those external realities.

Following that kind of guidance may make your notes *feel* more organized, but whether it makes you more productive and better at your job — that’s a different question entirely. (And the answer is often “no.”)

So here’s something different. Tim Cain, game director of the original *Fallout* (and other legendary games), sharing his note-taking process — drawing from *decades* of experience of taking notes in meetings, taking design notes, keeping an idea journal, work journal – in "real work" context! It’s worth your time:

<div class="js-reframe" style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.5%;"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbHlwUS7d4k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Note-Taking Best Practices" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;"></iframe></div>

To me, this was incredibly helpful. I've started writing again my *work journal* with Tim’s advice in mind. It’s been only a few days, but I can already see that it improves my work as an Associate Director at my day job.

I’m so glad I discovered Tim’s channel (YouTube suggested it after watching the *Fallout* tv show, *not creepy at all*). It’s great if you’re interested in game design, gaming industry, working in a team, or leading a team (or you just like *Fallout* and want to hear some anecdotes). Tim openly shares his expertise in all that. I highly recommend it!
