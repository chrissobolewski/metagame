*My App Library*

I find it (weirdly?) fun to list and take stock of all the apps that make one’s “productivity stack”. I enjoy reading about other people’s set-ups (a habit my wife won’t ever understand), so why not also put my own out there?

This is inspired by [Default Apps posts by Chris McLeod](https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/default-apps-for-2024/?ref=metagame.hk) and “uses” pages [like this one from Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/uses/?ref=metagame.hk). I will likely turn this into separate page one day, a living document updated regularly.

Additionally, this January 2025 edition serves as a good follow-up to my [iOS 18 Public Beta: Personal Computing Tools Audit](/posts/2024-08-13/ios-18-public-beta-personal-computing-tools-audit/) from August 2024, where I tried to fit my personal productivity needs entirely or almost entirely into Apple’s stock apps. Some of those did not last, as you can see below:

- **📨 Mail:** Apple Mail (recent app/OS updates made me realize I’ve been using Apple Mail all wrong; more on that some other time)
- **📆 Calendar:** Fantastical on desktop (no subscription, still riding that one-time purchase from years ago), Apple Calendar on mobile
- **✅ To-Do:** Things (eventually gave up on Reminders; Things just *feels like home*)
- **📝 Notes:** Apple Notes
- **🧭 Browser:** Safari
- **✍🏻 Journaling:** Apple Notes (experimenting with journaling using the [Forever ✱ Notes](https://www.myforevernotes.com/?ref=metagame.hk) framework; if it doesn’t work/stick, I will probably be back to Day One)
- **🌅 Photo Editing:** Photomator
- **📑 RSS, Read Later, News:** Readwise Reader
- **🔐 Password Management:** Apple Passwords
- **☁️ Cloud Storage:** iCloud
- **💸 Budgeting and Personal Finance:** Google Forms for data entry, Google Sheets for data storage and analysis (I should write more about this system of tracking personal and family finances, I love it so much)
- **🎵 Music:** Apple Music
- **🎙️ Podcasts:** Apple Podcasts
- **📚 Books:** Kindle
- **👨🏻💻 Blogging:** Ghost, iA Writer
- **🤖 AI:** mostly using Bing Chat for some initial desktop research, sometimes as a search engine(!); ChatGPT is not available in Hong Kong; Apple Intelligence doesn’t really count, does it?
- **📢 Social Media:** mostly lurking on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@ksobny?ref=metagame.hk) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ksobny.bsky.social?ref=metagame.hk); pretty much given up on posting (exception: links to these blog posts) — my short thoughts and dumb takes belong in my journal, not for everyone to see

All in all, I’m happy that I’ve mostly eliminated subscription software from my set-up (1Password, Pocket Casts, Lightroom, and jury’s still out on Day One).

And if you want to discuss any of the choices, tell me why I’m wrong, or just share your own — the blog comments are now open to all subscribers!
