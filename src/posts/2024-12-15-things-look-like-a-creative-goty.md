[Another](/posts/2023-08-01-a-strange-new-barbenheimer-film-grain/) round of random thoughts and updates. None of them deserve its own post, but a collection of these makes sense.

Here we go.

### Back to Things

Gave **Reminders** a good try [since the public betas this Summer](/posts/2024-08-13-ios-18-public-beta-personal-computing-tools-audit/) — and I’m back to **Things**.

Every time I switch to another to-do app I tell myself that it might be different this time. But then I always come back to **Things**. It just feels like home. It’s compatible with how my brain works and how I want to manage my tasks.

**Reminders**, despite the recent updates, still feels clunky, janky. Requires too many workarounds to bend it to my preferences. And, honestly, it’s ugly. While **Things** is just so pleasant to use (and to look at!)

### Creativity is problem-solving

YouTube algorithm sometimes hits the jackpot. Got this video on my Home page recently:

<div class="js-reframe" style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.5%;"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uB_bK3sSZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CREATIVE PHOTO PROJECT IDEAS — 7 Tips" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;"></iframe></div>

> Creativity is, in essence, another word for problem-solving.

That rings so true. If there’s no problem, no limitation to overcome, then I feel less passionate about photography. It offers no challenge so there’s no thrill. I *want* there to be problems to solve, things to figure out. Like, having to develop the film on my own — like I used to do years ago.

But then, there’s a competing pull toward convenience. Minimizing friction. Making things easier.

And I have let myself be pulled. Got multiple cameras, lenses for every occasion, and multiple photo editing apps on my phone. I am drowning in options. Problem is, I’m not drowning in good photos.

I need to reintroduce some limitations to make photography fun again for myself.

For example:

- One lens, one camera only
- Black and white only
- Manual focus only
- Manual exposure only
- Has to be somewhere else than the places I usually hang out
- Or limit yourself to just your neighborhood and find something worth photographing there
- JPG only

Going to try some of these out.

### GOTY

**The Game Awards** just *wrapped it up* and announced **Astro Bot** as the game of the year.

My *personal* game of the year is **Black Myth: Wukong**. Is it the best game of the year? I don’t know, probably not. I didn’t even play most of the nominees for game of the year at TGA. But **Wukong** was by far the game I enjoyed the most this year. Some factors that contributed to that:

- The difficulty felt so perfectly tuned to me. The bosses were challenging yet not these punishing, insurmountable walls from other souls-like games (except for Yellow Loong and Erlang). But not a cakewalk either. Every win inspired a feeling of achievement. Honestly, I’ve just gotten into **Path of Exile 2** and it feels more difficult than **Wukong**!
- Loved the setting. Finally something fresh and not another dark fantasy.
- Impressive graphics.
- Ability to enjoy it with friends and exchange tips and tactics.

Best game I’ve played this year and ~40 hours well spent!

### Leica FOTOS update

A massive update to Leica’s photo syncing app just before the end of the year!

In my [review](/posts/2024-09-29-leica-d-lux-8-as-a-travel-camera/) (or rather, *first impressions*) I expressed hope for **Leica D-Lux 8** to support Leica Looks eventually. In-camera filters/film simulations make a perfect pairing with a travel/everyday camera like **D-Lux 8**.

The new **FOTOS** app update brings that support and I’m so happy! Except, it’s not in-camera, baked-in Look like in **Leica Q3**. Instead, you can use the app to apply the Looks to JPGs you have already imported from your camera (and it’s not limited to **D-Lux**, all Leica JPGs are supported — in fact, any JPG you move manually to your “Leica” album can have a Look applied!)

I love this. And I’d argue it’s even better than in-camera Looks because when you do it through the app it’s non-destructive and you can control the strength of the filter.

Plus, there’s a new Look called *Brass*, which is basically their spin on Portra film simulation.

Update the app if you haven’t already!
