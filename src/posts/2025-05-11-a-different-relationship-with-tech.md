title: A different relationship with tech
excerpt: Less optimistic, more cynical.
---
My attitude towards *tech* has changed considerably in the last five years. 

No longer am I optimistic about where things are going. No longer am I excited about the new technology advancements. Because what are they, really? 

*We made a slightly better phone this year.* 

*We made a [slightly bigger and slightly more performant Switch](/posts/2025-04-03-a-lot-less-excited-about-nintendo-switch-2/) than the last one.*

Great, thank you.

The latest and greatest is not much greater than last year’s.

I was so [ready to replace my iPhone 13 Pro](/posts/2024-09-13-iphone-13-pro-exit-interview/) last year that I wrote it an eulogy — yet, ultimately I kept it for another year. 16 Pro was incredibly disappointing and I passed. A camera button and some half-baked “AI” features? Come on. 

I’m even thinking of skipping the 17s this year too. Just going to keep the 13 Pro until Apple finally releases a foldable. Hopefully next year! Now that would be something interesting — first time in a while.

But it’s a larger phenomenon than just a new iPhone being uninspiring. Tech just [isn’t fun anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-TANCVoHlc). [Being online is tiring](https://youtu.be/ctM2TIXDFQs?si=lQd1XUx8ud5tHuvI).

Enshittification and monetization are sucking all the joy out of everything. Websites, services, apps, platforms, games — getting worse every year while becoming more expensive at the same time. Finding new ways to squeeze out revenue instead of finding new ways of making a better product.

Just how long can this go on? There must be a limit where a product just becomes completely unusable under the weight of all that bullshit. At some point we won’t have any more money to spend on subscriptions, loot boxes, battle passes, micro-transactions, etc.

There must be a point where things finally break. When *people* break and don’t accept this nonsense anymore. Am I there already? Maybe that’s why I’m so surprisingly open to [the idea of trying out Linux](/posts/2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/)?
