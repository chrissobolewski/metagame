title: Google Zero, Small Web 1.0
excerpt: By denying us search traffic, Google has set us free.

It’s 2025. Internet is being flooded with AI slop and misinformation. Google doesn’t drive traffic anymore, [it keeps it for itself](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/) instead — with AI summaries and top results reserved exclusively for ads. [Social media throttle links](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/27/musk-x-throttle-links-threads-bluesky/).

This is not a great environment to build a new website in. Building an audience is harder than ever. But maybe, *just maybe* we can use this to our advantage.

There is value in independence from platforms and big tech. In maintaining a simple website that’s just files and folders — and not a database, scripts, and dynamic content. There is value in providing *a personal perspective on a personal website* to a small group of readers. Not everything has to scale, not everything has to pursue infinite growth, not everything has to be ruthlessly monetized.

Maybe returning to the Web 1.0 formula — a collection of websites connected through hyperlinks instead of social graphs and algorithms — is the way to go for small creators like myself.

I enjoy linking out to other bloggers and pointing my readers to things that I *found elsewhere* and *found interesting*. [Links are great](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/links-make-the-web-great/)! It’s so much better to send you into a rabbit-hole with a context-relevant link rather than stuffing this website with AI slop and SEO-optimized word salads. That’s where *small web* really shines. You can enjoy the process of discovery, feel a sense of wonder, and get lost in the web — it’s fun! 

METAGAME is a [Google Zero](https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience) blog. I receive pretty much zero traffic from search engines (apart from a handful of people encountering [my Leica D-Lux 8 post](https://metagame.hk/posts/2024-09-29-leica-d-lux-8-as-a-travel-camera/) that way) and social media. My dream/goal/hope is that other websites and blogs that I value would eventually link to something interesting they found *here*. That's how I want to build my audience.

Cutting our ability to reach more people sucks. But this might be a blessining in disguise. By denying us traffic, Google has set us free. We can write for humans again and care not for the SEO crawlers (and [block AI bots](https://www.theverge.com/news/695501/cloudflare-block-ai-crawlers-default)). Words once again flow from interest, values, and personality — not from a SEO manual. 

So go ahead, [explore my blogroll](https://metagame.hk/blogroll/). On top of that, here are two more blogs I’ve discovered just this past week. Diving into their archives now:
