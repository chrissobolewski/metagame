I genuinely wanted to be excited about **Switch 2** (it was my most anticipated hardware announcement this year!), yet – if I'm being honest with myself – it just looks like a bad buy for me:

- I've barely touched my Switch OLED since I bought it. (A painful realization!)
- [The Duskbloods](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/?ref=metagame.hk), *the* console-exclusive, that initially looked like it would scratch my *Bloodborne 2* itch – turns out it's a PvPvE game! No, thanks.
- Don't have any strong feelings or nostalgia for *Donkey Kong, Mario Kart,* or *Kirby*.
- Everything else, including *Hollow Knight: Silksong*, will be available on PC, it will look A LOT better there, and I already have Steam Deck OLED to play those games on the go (and with OLED!)
	- *Hollow Knight* with its art style in particular – I expect it to look much better on OLED compared to LCD.
	- Other than that, the third party games looked really poor. I know Switch isn't about high-end specs and cutting-edge graphics, but that's really not an excuse for releasing a game that looks like *Pokemon Legends Z-A* in 2025.
- Prices, both hardware and games, are high enough to give me pause.
- Speaking of prices, the fact they’re charging for their equivalent of *Astro’s Playroom* and *Aperture Desk Job* is such an own goal.

I expected something that would bring me back to the Switch — but last night's Nintendo Direct wasn't it.

All in all, whatever excitement I had about it initially is now fading. Maybe I was just hyped for an *idea* of a shiny new thing. Once I set emotions aside, Switch 2 doesn't look like a device for me.
