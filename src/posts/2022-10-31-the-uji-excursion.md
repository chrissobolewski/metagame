excerpt: Day twelve — Kyoto, Uji. Japan has just re-opened after COVID, and Kyoto is already packed. Need to escape the crowds.

*Day 12: Kyoto, Uji, 35,482 steps, 28.5 kilometers*

A lot of tea was had today.

But before that, let me check off one more item from [my Kyoto list](/posts/2022-10-30-avoid-kyoto-he-said/).

### Matcha Town

Uji. Just a 30-minute train ride form Kyoto Station.

Renown for its tea and widely considered to produce the highest grade of matcha.

I love how Uji has built its identity around this green powder. You see it everywhere. It’s in drinks, soba noodles, ice cream, candy, sweets, gyoza, ramen, dango… I’m not kidding.

And of course, you can smell it in the air too.

You can get over-caffeinated really quickly here. Simply can’t avoid having green tea in one form or another.

But one would be wrong to assume that matcha is the only thing that Uji has to offer. Oh, there’s more! Temples! Shrines! Historic bridges! Scenic views!

What really got me was the combination of autumn colors (ginkgo leaves just getting yellow!), the river, and the red bridges. Spent good few minutes just sitting there and admiring the view.

In the evening, I just aimlessly walked around the streets of Kyoto.Unfamiliar just two days ago — today, navigated with much more ease.

It’s my last night here. In Kyoto. In Japan. LOTS of feelings. This trip has challenged me physically (walking) and mentally (embracing the unknown, leaning on serendipity, talking to strangers, traveling solo…). It’s been intense — but in a good way.

I will post a proper summary some other time. But for now, I’m excited to go back home.

Programming note: tomorrow’s entry will likely be on the shorter side. I will be spending most of my day in transit.

Good night, good night, good night…
