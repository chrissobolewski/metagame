      <title>A different relationship with tech</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-11-a-different-relationship-with-tech/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My attitude towards &lt;em&gt;tech&lt;/em&gt; has changed considerably in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer am I optimistic about where things are going. No longer am I excited about the new technology advancements. Because what are they, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We made a slightly better phone this year.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-04-03-a-lot-less-excited-about-nintendo-switch-2/&quot;&gt;slightly bigger and slightly more performant Switch&lt;/a&gt; than the last one.&lt;/em&gt;
Great, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest and greatest is not much greater than last year’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2024-09-13-iphone-13-pro-exit-interview/&quot;&gt;ready to replace my iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year that I wrote it an eulogy — yet, ultimately I kept it for another year. 16 Pro was incredibly disappointing and I passed. A camera button and some half-baked “AI” features? Come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m even thinking of skipping the 17s this year too. Just going to keep the 13 Pro until Apple finally releases a foldable. Hopefully next year! Now that would be something interesting — first time in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a larger phenomenon than just a new iPhone being uninspiring. Tech just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-TANCVoHlc&quot;&gt;isn’t fun anymore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ctM2TIXDFQs?si=lQd1XUx8ud5tHuvI&quot;&gt;Being online is tiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enshittification and monetization is sucking all the joy out of everything. Websites, services, apps, platforms, games — getting worse every year while becoming more expensive at the same time. Finding new ways to squeeze out revenue instead of finding new ways of making a better product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how long can this go on? There must be a limit where a product just becomes completely unusable under the weight of all the enshittification. When we don’t have any more money to spend on subscriptions, loot boxes, battle passes, micro-transactions, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be a point where things finally break. When &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; break and don’t accept this shit anymore. Am I there already? Maybe that’s why I’m so surprisingly open to &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/&quot;&gt;the idea of trying out Linux&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This Is the Year of Linux on Desktop</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-05-04-this-is-the-year-of-linux-on-desktop/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a restless mind. I constantly look for ways to tinker with stuff. And once something works, I can&#39;t just leave it be and enjoy it. I have to move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-03-31-is-apple-even-good-at-software/&quot;&gt;Last month&lt;/a&gt; it was (re-)introducing pen and paper to my note-taking system. Before that, it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2024-12-15-things-look-like-a-creative-goty/&quot;&gt;back-and-forth between Reminders and Things&lt;/a&gt; for my to-do system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine how dangerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/pVI_smLgTY0?si=BmXPv3MjrxTFV14Z&amp;amp;ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;What’s stopping me right now is&lt;/s&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;Framework Laptops&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;s&gt;not shipping to Hong Kong…&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually installed Ubuntu on my gaming laptop today, alongside existing Windows 11 installation. Just to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t get far. I&#39;ll probably encounter some insurmountable barrier and give up. I will inevitably bump into some jankiness, critical apps with outdated design (looking at you, Libre Office), or things simply not working (as I write this I struggle to make my external monitor to work!) I just hope that some big disappointment happens before I manage to spend any extra money to plug Linux into my workflow. Because I would have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart my 1Password subscription for a cross-platform password manager (currently with Apple Passwords)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move my email from iCloud back to Fastmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable Obsidian sync, since my notes would no longer sync over iCloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a new to-do app (Tick Tick looks like a decent candidate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably subscribe to Spotify instead of Apple Music (or give YouTube Music another try?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming I stick with YouTube for #5, which at the moment doesn&#39;t cost me anything beyond what I&#39;m already paying, items 1-4 still add up to USD 215 per year. That is not insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s the cost of time required for setting everything up (though, let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s the fun part) and moving my to-do&#39;s to some new app (switching mission-critical apps, assuming you even find a suitable replacement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ljpuk.net/2025/05/04/tasks-out-of-sight-dont-get-done/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;can be a headache&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there&#39;s the sunk/opportunity cost in under-using (or not using at all) the devices I already own, primarily my iPad Pro and Mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I think about that last one – it raises the biggest question of all. Linux would primarily replace MacOS for me. But then, Mac is the only platform Apple has not fully locked down yet. So why even try to escape it now? With Mac, I don&#39;t have the same frustrations Windows users have. There is less incentive to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can do is to lay the groundwork for eventually leaving Apple&#39;s lock-in. A decision I&#39;m inching closer and closer to every time Apple does something greedy, malicious, or when it ingratiates itself with Trump. Which is very often these days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Lot Less Excited About Nintendo Switch 2 Than I Thought</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-04-03-a-lot-less-excited-about-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fnintendoswitch2.jpg&amp;width=1140&amp;format=avif&amp;via=transform 1140w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fnintendoswitch2.jpg&amp;width=1140&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 1140w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://metagame.hk/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fnintendoswitch2.jpg&amp;width=1140&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform&quot; alt=&quot;Nintendo Switch 2&quot; width=&quot;1140&quot; height=&quot;641&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch 2 / Image: Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I genuinely wanted to be excited about &lt;strong&gt;Switch 2&lt;/strong&gt; (it was my most anticipated hardware announcement this year!), yet – if I&#39;m being honest with myself – it just looks like a bad buy for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve barely touched my Switch OLED since I bought it. (A painful realization!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;The Duskbloods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; console-exclusive, that initially looked like it would scratch my &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne 2&lt;/em&gt; itch – turns out it&#39;s a PvPvE game! No, thanks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t have any strong feelings or nostalgia for &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong, Mario Kart,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Kirby&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything else, including &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight: Silksong&lt;/em&gt;, will be available on PC, it will look A LOT better there, and I already have Steam Deck OLED to play those games on the go (and with OLED!)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt; with its art style in particular – I expect it to look much better on OLED compared to LCD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than that, the third party games looked really poor. I know Switch isn&#39;t about high-end specs and cutting-edge graphics, but that&#39;s really not an excuse for releasing a game that looks like &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Legends Z-A&lt;/em&gt; in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices, both hardware and games, are high enough to give me pause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of prices, the fact they’re charging for their equivalent of &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Aperture Desk Job&lt;/em&gt; is such an own goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected something that would bring me back to the Switch — but last night&#39;s Nintendo Direct wasn&#39;t it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, whatever excitement I had about it initially is now fading. Maybe I was just hyped for an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of a shiny new thing. Once I set emotions aside, Switch 2 doesn&#39;t look like a device for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogging Like It&#39;s 2015</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-04-03-blogging-like-its-2015/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on my thoughts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-03-31-is-apple-even-good-at-software/&quot;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt; — I&#39;ll. be publishing shorter entries here. For a while — as an experiment. They would not go into the newsletter initially – instead they would wait their turn for the next monthly newsletter bundle-edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a bit of a manual process in Ghost, but I&#39;ll roll with it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ll have less pressure and more flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can still follow the blog in &lt;em&gt;real-time&lt;/em&gt; through RSS or social media links (I&#39;ll be cross-posting them using &lt;a href=&quot;https://openvibe.social/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;Openvibe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your inbox won&#39;t get spammed with multiple short post newsletters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you still prefer to receive updates via email, monthly newsletter edition will do just that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a worthwhile experiment to me! If it works out, it will encourage me to introduce more improvements (moving from Ghost to static pages, closer integration with the federated web, automating the newsletter digest, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#39;s the bubble I follow, but I&#39;m seeing a trend of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasonsantamaria.com/blog/once-again-from-the-top?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;returning to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ljpuk.net/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;small-scale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lmnt.me/blog/make-a-damn-website.html?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;personal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://rknight.me/blog/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; and withdrawing from social media. Owning what you create instead of feeding it into the algorithm. Tinkering with your own website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was passionate about this format 10-ish years ago (I used to have a small-but-award-winning personal finance blog) — hope I can find this feeling again, here and now. This experiment with shorter but more frequent posts is a step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Apple Even Good at Software?</title>
      <link>https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-03-31-is-apple-even-good-at-software/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fnewpenday.jpeg&amp;width=1140&amp;format=avif&amp;via=transform 1140w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://metagame.hk/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fnewpenday.jpeg&amp;width=1140&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 1140w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://metagame.hk/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fnewpenday.jpeg&amp;width=1140&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform&quot; alt=&quot;New pen day!&quot; width=&quot;1140&quot; height=&quot;855&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;em&gt;New pen day!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s entry is a mix of various topics. Each of the headlines below could’ve been its own tiny blog post, but since this is a blog &lt;em&gt;and a newsletter&lt;/em&gt;, I feel this pressure of not spamming your inboxes with tiny stuff — whatever I send out needs to be substantial. So I bundle these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s actually something I need to think about. Sometimes I want the freedom of just firing off a short post over here. I like that format! Especially since I don’t really post on social media anymore, so this page could be a nice outlet for small updates like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to look into Ghost options — or maybe consider migrating to static pages (11ty?) and building my website around that? An ideal outcome would be some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;POSSE solution&lt;/a&gt; with a (monthly?) newsletter digest getting compiled in the background. Hold that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, this is what I’ve got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Pen Day!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have sunk in deeply into a new hobby — fountain pens and related stationery (notebooks, in particular).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we lived our lives mostly offline, online was an escape from the real world. But now more and more we live our lives online. And this time the real world becomes an escape — from notifications, distractions, predatory monetization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, researching fountain pens, notebooks, pen loops, modded iPods, and trying to find an excuse to get into film photography again. But let’s stick to stationery for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like having another thing in life to &lt;em&gt;figure out&lt;/em&gt;. Another area to explore. Something new. I’m just worried it will be superficial, that my handwritten journaling will be mostly writing about writing. Running around in circles like that. I have fallen into that trap before, with my “note-taking” node in Obsidian having the most linked-to notes at one point. I’m worried that I will focus on the tools and not the process. That I will write ideas down, sure, but then do nothing with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is some doubt among all this excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, I’m having fun. Enjoying the morning ritual of journaling in my notebook, the nib gliding on the paper, and leaving a trace of ink with nice shading. And it’s one more way in which I can use my iPhone less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But No New Bag Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak Design’s Kickstarter campaign for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/roller-pro-carry-on-luggage-by-peak-design?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;the new carry-on suitcase&lt;/a&gt; is live, after LOTS of teasing. Looking at the price, specs, and reviews this one is a &lt;em&gt;skip&lt;/em&gt; for me. 4 kilograms for a carry-on, are you kidding me? This is a very US-specific product. It’s (literally) not going to fly here in Asia, where most of the airlines have 7 kgs limits for carry-ons. Oh well, that’s $500 &lt;s&gt;saved&lt;/s&gt; not spent. And my &lt;em&gt;no new bags in 2025&lt;/em&gt; commitment for this year can stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smartphone Best Practices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rolling back to using my iPhone less… I have been inspired/moved by this article from Miłosz Bolechowski: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powoli.blog/o-higienie-uzywania-smartfona/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;o higienie używania smartfona&lt;/a&gt; (beware! – it&#39;s in Polish and behind a paywall). TLDR: the more you disconnect, the more you get done, the fuller your days are, the more meaningful your conversations are. Smartphone should not be a constant companion in everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach: I consider the phone as a utility toolkit. It’s for giving me access to bank apps, passwords, photo import &amp;amp; editing apps, notes, maps, and communication. I limit notifications (including badges) to the critical and time-sensitive ones. Only non-algorithm entertainment is allowed: RSS, books, music, podcasts. No social media, no YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s working out so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, my iPad is a different story. What I limit on the iPhone, I often (over-)compensate with my tablet usage. As a next step, I’ll need to tackle that somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, my early mornings are now device-free. Just coffee, pen, and paper. Feels good. Feels pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;99% Pure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of interesting reads — another article that made an impression on me recently was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joanwestenberg.com/on-ideological-purity/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;On Ideological Purity&lt;/a&gt; by Joan Westenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the thing: I try to make thoughtful purchasing choices — not only in making sure that the products I buy will fit my life/needs well, but also aiming to support good/ethical businesses. Voting with my wallet. Thing is, it’s not always easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Twitter, Facebook, and Threads, I’m avoiding Amazon (them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;turning off book downloads&lt;/a&gt; was the final straw), I try to support local businesses in Hong Kong (especially those that supported the local community in trying times), I don’t give Google analytics about Metagame’s readers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also give my money to Apple — begrudgingly, even though I’m trying to avoid making big tech CEOs even richer. I’m increasingly disappointed by their choices, tech-related and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/3/24335290/apple-donation-donald-trump-inauguration-tim-cook?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;, yet I will likely buy something in the Apple Store this September. And I will occasionally buy something from Amazon, if I can’t get it elsewhere. I still sometimes use Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. And there are many other examples where my spending (be it money or time/attention) doesn’t exactly align with my values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to feel guilty about it. &lt;em&gt;If I’m not 100% pure in my choices, then what is even the point?&lt;/em&gt; But Joan’s article beat some sense back into me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have to be 100% perfect in my anti-capitalist, anti-corporate, anti-US/big-tech choices. As long as I’m mindful, act with intention, and doing my best, doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; — that’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfection is not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is Apple Good At Software?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of begrudging Apple and things being imperfect, I&#39;ve been feeling negative about that company for a while. They keep giving me reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/629940/apple-siri-robby-walker-delayed-ai-features?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;Apple Intelligence is a joke&lt;/a&gt;. The only remotely useful thing it was supposed to offer got delayed indefinitely. Passwords app was prone to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/18/apples-passwords-app-was-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks-for-nearly-three-months-after-launch/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;embarrassing vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; for months. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/stories/not-an-ipad-pro-review/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;iPad is still a baby computer&lt;/a&gt;; hardware generations ahead of its software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is just a sample from the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to bounce between &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2024-08-13-ios-18-public-beta-personal-computing-tools-audit/&quot;&gt;going all-in on Apple’s apps&lt;/a&gt;, prioritizing ecosystem integration — and, on the other end of the spectrum — replacing Apple’s solutions with third-party apps, looking for ones that are best in class. Sometimes, I’ll add extra difficulty by searching for apps that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://ljpuk.net/2025/03/27/a-move-to-cross-platform-apps-and-services/?ref=metagame.hk&quot;&gt;cross-platform&lt;/a&gt;. A classic dilemma between a jack-of-all-trades approach and best-in-breed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple will cover all the basics with Reminders, Notes, Journal, etc. — but it’s rarely going to be the best solution in each slot. Their apps will get infrequent updates (at best once a year between WWDC and new iPhone release; at worst - forgotten/becoming an afterthought, like Clips or Journal). Always two steps behind the industry trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, third party apps still innovate. To me and for my needs, Fantastical is a better calendar app than Apple Calendar. 1Password is a better password manager than Apple Passwords. Day One is a better journaling app than Apple Journal. Things is a better to-do app than Apple Reminders. Notes — here I’m having a hard time finding a 1-to-1 replacement. Obsidian may be better for PKM stuff and long-term storage, but short-term quick capture is not its best suit (but hey, pen and paper exists!). But then, you lose some benefits of deep integration with the OS and some money as well (as most of the best third party apps out there require a subscription these days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what good is system integration if the biggest benefit, integrating information across various apps in your account and making personalized suggestions based on that, Apple promises — but can’t ship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like I will never solve this dilemma. Every choice is a trade-off. It&#39;s becoming easier, though, because more and more Apple and its solutions seem to be offering less and less (relative to competition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that my next &lt;a href=&quot;https://metagame.hk/posts/2025-01-09-default-apps-for-2025/&quot;&gt;default apps list&lt;/a&gt; will have fewer Apple apps on it. Unless, of course, next WWDC wows me in a big way this June (which seems unlikely?)&lt;/p&gt;
