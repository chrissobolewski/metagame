            <h2>Things Look Like a Creative GOTY</h2>
            <time>15 December 2024</time>
            <p><a href="../2023-08-01-a-strange-new-barbenheimer-film-grain/">Another</a> round of random thoughts and updates. None of them deserve its own post, but a collection of these makes sense.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<h3>Back to Things</h3>
<p>Gave <strong>Reminders</strong> a good try <a href="../2024-08-13-ios-18-public-beta-personal-computing-tools-audit/">since the public betas this Summer</a> — and I’m back to <strong>Things</strong>.</p>
<p>Every time I switch to another to-do app I tell myself that it might be different this time. But then I always come back to <strong>Things</strong>. It just feels like home. It’s compatible with how my brain works and how I want to manage my tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Reminders</strong>, despite the recent updates, still feels clunky, janky. Requires too many workarounds to bend it to my preferences. And, honestly, it’s ugly. While <strong>Things</strong> is just so pleasant to use (and to look at!)</p>
<h3>Creativity is problem-solving</h3>
<p>YouTube algorithm sometimes hits the jackpot. Got this video on my Home page recently:</p>
<div class="js-reframe" style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.5%;"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uB_bK3sSZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CREATIVE PHOTO PROJECT IDEAS — 7 Tips" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;"></iframe></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Creativity is, in essence, another word for problem-solving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That rings so true. If there’s no problem, no limitation to overcome, then I feel less passionate about photography. It offers no challenge so there’s no thrill. I <em>want</em> there to be problems to solve, things to figure out. Like, having to develop the film on my own — like I used to do years ago.</p>
<p>But then, there’s a competing pull toward convenience. Minimizing friction. Making things easier.</p>
<p>And I have let myself be pulled. Got multiple cameras, lenses for every occasion, and multiple photo editing apps on my phone. I am drowning in options. Problem is, I’m not drowning in good photos.</p>
<p>I need to reintroduce some limitations to make photography fun again for myself.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>One lens, one camera only</li>
<li>Black and white only</li>
<li>Manual focus only</li>
<li>Manual exposure only</li>
<li>Has to be somewhere else than the places I usually hang out</li>
<li>Or limit yourself to just your neighborhood and find something worth photographing there</li>
<li>JPG only</li>
</ul>
<p>Going to try some of these out.</p>
<h3>GOTY</h3>
<p><strong>The Game Awards</strong> just <em>wrapped it up</em> and announced <strong>Astro Bot</strong> as the game of the year.</p>
<p>My <em>personal</em> game of the year is <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>. Is it the best game of the year? I don’t know, probably not. I didn’t even play most of the nominees for game of the year at TGA. But <strong>Wukong</strong> was by far the game I enjoyed the most this year. Some factors that contributed to that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difficulty felt so perfectly tuned to me. The bosses were challenging yet not these punishing, insurmountable walls from other souls-like games (except for Yellow Loong and Erlang). But not a cakewalk either. Every win inspired a feeling of achievement. Honestly, I’ve just gotten into <strong>Path of Exile 2</strong> and it feels more difficult than <strong>Wukong</strong>!</li>
<li>Loved the setting. Finally something fresh and not another dark fantasy.</li>
<li>Impressive graphics.</li>
<li>Ability to enjoy it with friends and exchange tips and tactics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best game I’ve played this year and ~40 hours well spent!</p>
<h3>Leica FOTOS update</h3>
<p>A massive update to Leica’s photo syncing app just before the end of the year!</p>
<p>In my <a href="../2024-09-29-leica-d-lux-8-as-a-travel-camera/">review</a> (or rather, <em>first impressions</em>) I expressed hope for <strong>Leica D-Lux 8</strong> to support Leica Looks eventually. In-camera filters/film simulations make a perfect pairing with a travel/everyday camera like <strong>D-Lux 8</strong>.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffotos.jpeg&width=1600&format=avif&via=transform 1600w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffotos.jpeg&width=1600&format=webp&via=transform 1600w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffotos.jpeg&width=1600&format=jpeg&via=transform" alt="Two screenshots of Leica FOTOS app" width="1600" height="1510"></picture>
<em>Two screenshots of Leica FOTOS app</em></p>
<p>The new <strong>FOTOS</strong> app update brings that support and I’m so happy! Except, it’s not in-camera, baked-in Look like in <strong>Leica Q3</strong>. Instead, you can use the app to apply the Looks to JPGs you have already imported from your camera (and it’s not limited to <strong>D-Lux</strong>, all Leica JPGs are supported — in fact, any JPG you move manually to your “Leica” album can have a Look applied!)</p>
<p>I love this. And I’d argue it’s even better than in-camera Looks because when you do it through the app it’s non-destructive and you can control the strength of the filter.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s a new Look called <em>Brass</em>, which is basically their spin on Portra film simulation.</p>
<p>Update the app if you haven’t already!</p>
